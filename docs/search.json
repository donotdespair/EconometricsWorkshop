    "text": "Abstracts\n\nEstimand of Instrumental Variable Estimator for Any Outcome and Any Heterogeneous Effect\nMyoung-Jae Lee\nFor a binary treatment D, an outcome Y and covariates X, a linear model with a constant treatment effect is widely used, but the linear model is untenable if Y is a limited dependent variable (LDV) with a continuous covariate. Despite this problem, motivations to use a linear model are strong when D is endogenous, because dealing with a binary endogenous D and a LDV Y is particularly difficult unless a fully parametric approach is adopted. Hence, practitioners often apply instrumental variable estimator (IVE) to a linear model with a LDV Y. In this paper, firstly, we show that IVE with a binary instrument Z for D estimates a ‘weighted average of X-heterogeneous effects on compliers’ plus a bias term, where the bias is not zero in general unless a restrictive condition is met. Secondly, the bias can be reduced much by specifying the X-part in the linear model such that the X-part explains Z well, not necessarily Y. Thirdly, a modified IVE using the ‘instrument residual’ instead of Z has zero bias without the restrictive condition. An empirical analysis is provided to demonstrate these points.\n\n\nAsymptotics of Functional Spectral Component Analysis with Weakly Dependent Data\nBo Hu\nWe develop the asymptotic theory for principal spectral analysis of weakly dependent functional data in a separable Hilbert space. Principal spectral analysis is the analysis on statistical quantities that are representable by spectral characteristics of certain operators that are used to summarize the data. Principal spectral analysis includes, but is not limited to, the prominent example of principal component analysis. We give examples of principal spectral analysis with functional data, and with a version of the functional central limit theorem, we show how we may establish the limit distributions of quantities in principal spectral analysis in a unified framework, allowing the functional data to be weakly dependent.\n\n\nThe underdamped oscillation MIDAS model\nDavid Harris\nWe propose a flexible parametric MIDAS model that allows for overshooting by drawing on the literature for oscillating systems. Unlike exponential Almon or beta lags, weights can change sign. The model is parsimonious, easy to estimate, and includes a decay parameter that avoids endpoint restrictions. Asymptotic consistency of the non-linear least squares estimator is established and simulations support the approach in finite samples. The model is illustrated via out of sample forecasts of monthly changes in US inflation with a daily commodity price index, and the growth rate in US industrial production with the CBOE volatility index.\n\n\nVerifying Sources of Identification of Structural Vector Autoregressions Using the BETEL Framework\nTomasz Woźniak\nWe employ a spike’n’slab prior distribution to discriminate between moment conditions identifying a fiscal policy structural vector autoregression. Various sources of identification, including instrumental variables as well as symmetric and asymmetric kurtosis, are presented as moment conditions informing the estimation of the structural parameters. Exclusion restrictions are also considered. The spike’n’slab prior is used to verify these conditions within a single MCMC run. We use a three-variable system for the US fiscal policy analysis to show that the structural parameters are identified thanks to the non-normal innovations and exclusion restrictions rather than via instruments or heteroskedasticity."
